In this example, the `bind()` method is used to ensure that the `this` keyword inside the `handleClick()` method refers to the correct instance of the `React` class.

### Breakdown of the Code

1. **React Class**:
   - A `React` class is created with a constructor.
   - Inside the constructor, two properties are defined:
     - `this.library = "React"`: Sets the `library` property to "React".
     - `this.server = "https://localhost:300"`: Sets the `server` property to a URL string.
   - The `constructor` also selects the `<button>` element on the page and attaches a click event listener to it using `addEventListener`.

2. **Event Listener**:
   - This line attaches a click event listener to the button:
     ```javascript
     document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', this.handleClick.bind(this));
     ```
   - `this.handleClick.bind(this)` is used to bind the `handleClick()` method to the current instance of the `React` class.

3. **Why `bind()` is Needed**:
   - In JavaScript, when you pass a method as a callback (like in an event listener), the context (`this`) inside the method can be lost. By default, the `this` keyword inside `handleClick()` would refer to the element that triggered the event (in this case, the button), not the `React` class instance.
   - If we hadn't used `.bind(this)`, the `this` inside `handleClick()` would refer to the button, not the instance of the `React` class, so `this.server` would be `undefined`.

   Without `bind()`, the click event wouldn't have access to the `server` property in the class, and calling `this.server` inside `handleClick()` would lead to an error.

4. **`bind(this)` Fixes the `this` Context**:
   - The `bind()` method explicitly sets the context of `this` in `handleClick()` to the current instance of the `React` class (the `app` object).
   - As a result, when the button is clicked, the `this.server` inside `handleClick()` correctly refers to the `server` property of the `React` class instance.

### Behavior of the Code

- When the button is clicked, the `handleClick()` method is executed.
- `this.server` correctly refers to `"https://localhost:300"`, so the console will output:
  ```bash
  button clicked
  https://localhost:300
  ```

### Without `bind()`
If `bind()` was not used and the code was like this:
```javascript
.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick)
```
Then, clicking the button would cause an error or unexpected behavior, because `this` inside `handleClick()` would refer to the button element, not the `React` class instance. As a result, `this.server` would be `undefined` or not exist.

### Conclusion
In summary, `bind(this)` in this example ensures that the `this` inside the `handleClick()` method correctly refers to the `React` class instance, allowing access to class properties like `this.server`.
