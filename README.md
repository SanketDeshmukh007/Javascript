# üñ•Ô∏è JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my **JavaScript Learning Journey** repository! üöÄ  
This repository documents my progress in learning JavaScript, showcasing the key concepts I've learned. I studied JavaScript through Hitesh Choudhary's YouTube channel, **Chai Aur Code**, and I'm excited to share my growth!

## üåü Introduction

JavaScript is a powerful programming language, widely used for web development. I've been following Hitesh Choudhary's YouTube series on **Chai Aur Code** to grasp the fundamentals and dive deeper into JavaScript. I've covered a lot of essential topics that will help me create practical applications in the future.

## üß† Concepts Covered

Here's a breakdown of the JavaScript concepts I've studied:

1. **Variables and Data Types**  
   Studied how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const` and explored data types like strings, numbers, and booleans.

2. **Functions and Scope**  
   Learned how to define and invoke functions, understand function scopes, and closure principles.

3. **Control Flow (Loops & Conditionals)**  
   Mastered control structures including `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops, and conditional statements like `if/else` and `switch`.

4. **Objects and Arrays**  
   Explored how to create, manipulate, and iterate over objects and arrays.

5. **ES6 Features**  
   Covered new JavaScript features such as arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators, etc.

6. **DOM Manipulation**  
   Gained knowledge on how to access and modify HTML elements using JavaScript (e.g., `document.querySelector`, `innerHTML`, and more).

7. **Event Handling**  
   Learned to handle user interactions like button clicks, form submissions, and other DOM events.

8. **Asynchronous JavaScript**  
   Gained an understanding of handling asynchronous operations using callbacks, Promises, and async/await.

9. **APIs and Fetch**  
   Practiced fetching data from external APIs using `fetch()` and handling JSON responses.

10. **Error Handling**  
    Learned how to use `try`, `catch`, and `finally` to manage errors in JavaScript.

You can find my code snippets for each of these topics in the `concepts/` folder in this repository.

## üìö Learning Resources

I primarily learned JavaScript from the following resource:

- **YouTube**: [Hitesh Choudhary's Chai Aur Code - JavaScript Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode)

Other supplementary resources I referred to:

- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)
- [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

## üöÄ How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-learning-journey.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd javascript-learning-journey
   ```

3. Open the folder in your preferred code editor and explore the code snippets in the `concepts/` folder.

To test the code, you can use a browser console or a Node.js environment.
